                   <strong> Open Debate: Maintenance of International Peace and Security. </strong><br>
                   <strong> Debate and Briefing: Comprehensive review of the situation in the Middle East and North Africa. (Regional Discussion)</strong>
                   <br>
                   The maintenance of international peace and security has become a pressing issue of this era. Peace may be achieved through the use of military force. But such an achievement would threaten security. Hence it turns out to be problem that can only be solved through an integrated approach and early action. In order to sustain peace, the Security Council will have to devote more attention to preventing conflicts from either occurring in the first place or recurring in post conflict situations. This would mean addressing some of the underlying causes of these compounded conflicts which are plentiful, ranging from poverty reduction to human rights or even climate change. Protection against grave violations of human rights might require military use, and the connection between international peace and security and the respect for human rights is evident in the practice of the UN Security Council, pushing us into a true dilemma.<br>The popular uprisings in North Africa in 2011 brought into focus questions about the international community to successfully prevent violent conflicts in Africa. The region, destabilized by political and security challenges caused by weak governance and religiously driven violences increasex since 2011 Libyan crisis has caused large conflicts. Further, many borders in the Middle East have become porous, allowing for an easier circulation of migrants and armed fighters, as well as of trafficked goods. Since 2015, jihadists pledging allegiance to ISIS have also been present in the Egyptian Sinai. Hence, the long-term resolution of this conflict is paramount to improving regional security, promoting peace, and saving human lives. This committee will both encourage a development of post-conflict peacebuilding framework and address a variety of geopolitical crises.

                   <strong>Agenda: Establishment of a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in the MENA Region.</strong>
                   <br>As a part of the summit which led to the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the 1995 NPT Review Conference called for the  “the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical and biological, and their delivery systems.” This was first proposed by Egypt in 1950, and prompted again by the same party in 1998. This led to studies which examined the feasibility of establishing such a nuclear weapon free zone in the region. <br>Many countries are in favour of moving forward with this agenda, because of the potential effects of the same: promoting global nuclear disarmament and helping the Middle East achieve peace. As of 2014, three countries in the Middle East have been found in non-compliance with their IAEA safeguards obligations under the NPT: Iraq, Iran and Syria. Of these cases, Syria remains unresolved.<br>The committee must move forward in a direction such as to reach unanimous consensus amongst the nations of the MENA region, regarding the intent and the specific implementation of a ‘Nuclear Weapon Free Zone’ in the region.

                   <strong>Agenda: Protection and promotion of human rights of refugees, IDPs in armed conflict zones with special reference to middle East.</strong>
                   <br>A refugee is a person who "owing to a well-founded fear of being
persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country
of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is
unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country".But
Internally displaced people (IDPs) have not crossed a border to find
safety. Unlike refugees, they are on the run at home. IDPs stay within
their own country and remain under the protection of its government,
even if that government is the reason for their displacement.<br>

Internally displaced persons (IDPs) flee their homes for the same
reasons as refugees, but remain within their own country and are thus
subject to the laws of that state. At the end of 2017, some 40 million
people were internally displaced due to armed conflict, generalized
violence or human rights violations, according to Internal
Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC).<br>


In 2012, countries in the broader Middle East were experiencing a
fresh wave of instability and violent unrest. Since then the
humanitarian costs in the region have been vast as unrest and violence
in Libya, Syria, Iraq and Yemen have spiralled into fully-fledged
armed conflict, while other countries were exposed to the impact of
war and fell themselves partly into political unrest. Today, from the
conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen alone, 50 million people are in
need of aid and 19 million people are displaced.<br>

The regional and global dimensions of these conflicts are of serious
concern, as the dynamics are less and less conducive towards political
solutions. The need of the hour is to create a conducive environment
to discuss the humanitarian side to these conflicts, and how to
amicably resolve the fate of those who are displaced.

                             <strong> Debate and Briefing: Comprehensive review of the situation in the Middle East and North Africa. (Regional Discussion)</strong>
                             <br>
                             The maintenance of international peace and security has become a pressing issue of this era. Peace may be achieved through the use of military force. But such an achievement would threaten security. Hence it turns out to be problem that can only be solved through an integrated approach and early action. In order to sustain peace, the Security Council will have to devote more attention to preventing conflicts from either occurring in the first place or recurring in post conflict situations. This would mean addressing some of the underlying causes of these compounded conflicts which are plentiful, ranging from poverty reduction to human rights or even climate change. Protection against grave violations of human rights might require military use, and the connection between international peace and security and the respect for human rights is evident in the practice of the UN Security Council, pushing us into a true dilemma.<br>The popular uprisings in North Africa in 2011 brought into focus questions about the international community to successfully prevent violent conflicts in Africa. The region, destabilized by political and security challenges caused by weak governance and religiously driven violences increasex since 2011 Libyan crisis has caused large conflicts. Further, many borders in the Middle East have become porous, allowing for an easier circulation of migrants and armed fighters, as well as of trafficked goods. Since 2015, jihadists pledging allegiance to ISIS have also been present in the Egyptian Sinai. Hence, the long-term resolution of this conflict is paramount to improving regional security, promoting peace, and saving human lives. This committee will both encourage a development of post-conflict peacebuilding framework and address a variety of geopolitical crises.

                             <strong>Agenda: Establishment of a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in the MENA Region.</strong>
                             <br>As a part of the summit which led to the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the 1995 NPT Review Conference called for the  “the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical and biological, and their delivery systems.” This was first proposed by Egypt in 1950, and prompted again by the same party in 1998. This led to studies which examined the feasibility of establishing such a nuclear weapon free zone in the region. <br>Many countries are in favour of moving forward with this agenda, because of the potential effects of the same: promoting global nuclear disarmament and helping the Middle East achieve peace. As of 2014, three countries in the Middle East have been found in non-compliance with their IAEA safeguards obligations under the NPT: Iraq, Iran and Syria. Of these cases, Syria remains unresolved.<br>The committee must move forward in a direction such as to reach unanimous consensus amongst the nations of the MENA region, regarding the intent and the specific implementation of a ‘Nuclear Weapon Free Zone’ in the region.
